; This table maps tiles (1-8) to tile representations, per level.
; space is 00, floor1 is 1 and collapse is 7 & key is 8.  Only 0 through 7
; encoded in the level data.  Key, door and switch added programatically to
; the level.  The switch looks the same in both kong levels (only place it
; is present) so it doesn't need/get an entry.  The door "tile" isn't seen,
; so isn't rendered.  It's below the door sprite for collision purposes only.
;
